# AuraVerity Hybrid dApp

A hybrid decentralized application for deepfake detection, combining a Python AI backend with a decentralized frontend on the Internet Computer (ICP).

This repository contains two main projects:
- `deepfake_webapp`: The Flask-based AI analysis server.
- `truth_chain`: The ICP-based decentralized frontend.

See the README file inside each sub-directory for specific setup and run instructions.
